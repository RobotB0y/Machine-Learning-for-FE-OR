Movie Recommendation Project

1. Data preprocessing:
Load the data into a suitable data structure such as pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation.
Handle missing values, if any.
Convert data types if necessary (e.g., timestamp to datetime).


2. Feature engineering:
Extract useful features from the dataset that can help improve recommendations.
Merge the 'movies.csv' and 'ratings.csv' files on the 'movieId' column to get a combined dataset with movie details and user ratings.
Calculate the average rating for each movie.
Calculate the number of ratings received by each movie.


3. Define the recommendation logic:
You can choose between several approaches, such as content-based, collaborative filtering, or hybrid methods.
A simple approach could be to rank movies by their popularity and average rating:

Rank movies based on their average rating, considering only movies with a minimum number of ratings (e.g., 50 or 100) to avoid bias from movies with few ratings.
Another approach could be to use collaborative filtering, which can be further divided into two types:

User-based: Find users similar to the target user, and recommend movies based on the preferences of these similar users.
Item-based: Find movies similar to the ones the target user has liked, and recommend similar movies based on these preferences.
Model selection:
Choose a suitable model for your recommendation logic. For collaborative filtering, you can use models such as k-nearest neighbors, matrix factorization, or deep learning-based models.

4. Model training and evaluation:

Split the dataset into a training set and a test set.
Train the chosen model on the training set.
Evaluate the model's performance on the test set using appropriate metrics (e.g., mean squared error, precision, recall, F1-score).
Model deployment:
Deploy the trained model as a REST API or a web application that takes user input and returns movie recommendations.

5. Model deployment:
Deploy the trained model as a REST API or a web application that takes user input and returns movie recommendations.
